# python_project_dragrace
This is my class project that utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, a wikipedia api,Python, flask, and MySQL to save user data, contestant data, and comment data.
The projects goal is to be a Rupaul's Dragrace contestants tracker.
You can see the list of states that has a queen, create a comment for that specific queen, and update and delete your own comment. Commments that are not your can not be deleted.
Users must register and login to have access to the full project.
